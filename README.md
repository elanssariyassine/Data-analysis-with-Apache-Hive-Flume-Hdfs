# **Twitter Sentiment analysis with Apache Hive,Flume,Hdfs**

## Introduction
The sentiment analysis is one of the important analysis areas of Twitter messages that can be very useful in decision making. Performing sentiment analysis on Twitter is more challenging than doing it for lengthy reviews. This is because tweets are very short (approximately 140 characters only) and usually contain slang, emoticons, hashtag tags, and other Twitter-specific jargon. For Twitter development purposes, Twitter provides a streaming API that allows developers to access 1% of tweets on a particular keyword.

### How can we analyze Twitter data using big data tools? 
Our analysis aims to answer the following questions: 
✓ What were the hashtags used and how many times was each hashtag used? 
✓ Identify the most trending hashtag of the day and how many times it was tweeted. 
✓ Determine the score of each posted tweet. Identify if the tweet had a positive or negative sentiment
